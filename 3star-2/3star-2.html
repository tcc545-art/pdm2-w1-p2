            <p><em>This is an advanced exercise! You may not finish it during the practical session.</em></p>
            <p>Create your own version of a basic card game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights" target="_blank">Crazy Eights</a> is 
            recommended as it is fairly simple but still requires you to think carefully about your choice 
        of data structures. You can choose a different game but make sure it is for two players 
    AND requires the player to make a strategic choice. Games like Snap, which are based on pure luck and speed, are not appropriate.</p>
            <p>Your user should play against the computer and your AI should be reasonably strategic. Choose 
                your data structures so that your AI can make a good choice! For example, in Crazy Eights, players 
                must match the suit or value of the last card played, or they can play an 8 and 
                choose a new suit. If the player can't go, they have to draw new cards from the deck until they 
                can go. As the objective of the game is to be the first to play all your cards, strategic decisions 
                will seek to maximise the player's ability to play without drawing a new card, or to cause their opponent 
                to draw one or more new cards. To make a strategic decision, search and sorting by suit and value is important.

                in a standard deck.</p>
