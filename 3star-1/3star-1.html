    <h1>3 Star - Exercise 1 - Noughts and crosses</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <p><em>This is an advanced exercise! You may not finish it during the practical session.</em></p>
            <p>The focus of this exercise is to revisit your solution to the 3 star exercise from last time (noughts and crosses) and see if you can make your algorithm for determining if a player has won the game more efficient. Alternatively, you can start from the 
                sample solution (go to the <a href="https://github.com/UoY-IM-PDM2-2324/PDM2-example-code" target="_blank">example code repo</a> / Practical solutions / W1P1 / 3star and copy the contents of sketch.js). If you choose to use the sample solution, the code 
                to optimise can be found in the <code>checkWinner()</code> function.
            </p>
            <p>If you're working on your own code, look at your current 
                algorithm and determine how many squares on the board it 
                checks to figure out if there is a winner. Determine if it performs 
            better (fewer checks) in some cases than others. If you're using the sample 
        code, this step was covered in lecture so you may find it helpful to revisit the slides.</p>
        <p>Try to make this portion of the code as efficient as possible. It should be possible to come up with 
            a solution that checks the contents of, at most, eight squares on the board.

                    <p>There is one square on the board that can be part of more winning lines than any other. Use this to determine your 
                        worst case scenario.
