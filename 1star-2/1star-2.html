    <h1>1 Star - Exercise 2</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In this exercise, you will create a sketch that changes fill and stroke 
                colours based on the number of times the user has clicked the mouse.
            </p>
            <p>Here are the steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In sketch.js, create two Maps: one to store fill colours and one to store stroke colours. You will also need a variable to track 
                    the number of times the mouse has been clicked.
                </li>
                <li>After <code>createCanvas()</code> has been called, populate both maps with integer keys and <code>color</code> values. The keys represent the number of times 
                    the user has clicked the mouse and the values represent the colour to change the fill or stroke to when that click count has been reached. You don't need 
                    to set colours for every click. For example, in my code, I have fill colour Map entries for 1, 2, 4, 7, 11 etc. clicks, and I have stroke colour Map 
                    entries for different click counts so that stroke and fill change at different times.</li>
                <li>Implement <code>mouseClicked()</code> and use it to draw shapes in random locations. There should be the same number of shapes 
                as there have been mouse clicks e.g. if the user has clicked the mouse twice, there should be two shapes on screen.</li>
                <li>Use the Maps to set the fill and stroke colours: if a Map contains a key matching the number of clicks, set the colour using the value in the map.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

                    need to use three methods: one to set the key-value pairs in each Map, one to check if a Map has a particular key, 
                    and one to get the value associated with a particular key.</p>
